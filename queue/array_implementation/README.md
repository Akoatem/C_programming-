What is a Queue in C?
In contrast to a stack, a queue in C is nothing but a linear data structure that follows the FIFO rule (First In First Out). Insertion is done from the back (the rear end) and deletion is done from the front.
We can implement a queue in 2 ways:
Statically: Array implementation of queues allows the static memory allocation of its data elements. It is important to note that in this method, the queue acquires all the features of an array.
Dynamically: Linked list implementation of queues follow the dynamic memory allocation of its data elements. It is important to note that in this method, the queue inherits all the characteristics of a linked list.
